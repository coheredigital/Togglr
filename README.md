# Togglr

A minimalistic CSS class toggling utility for use with [Cash](https://kenwheeler.github.io/cash/) (An absurdly small jQuery alternative for modern browsers).

I primarily published this repository for personal use so that I could easily integrate it with [jsdelivr.com](jsdelivr.com/) when using it on [Niagara Falls Tourism](https://www.niagarafallstourism.com/) and client website.
